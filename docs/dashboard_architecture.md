# Test Dashboard Architecture

## Overview
The test dashboard is a real-time monitoring system that provides continuous feedback on test status, code quality, and project health. It is designed to be project-agnostic and easily integrated into any development workflow.

## Core Components

### 1. Dashboard Server (serve_dashboard.py)
- Lightweight HTTP server serving static files
- CORS-enabled for local development
- Handles file serving and routing

### 2. Dashboard UI (dashboard/index.html)
- Real-time test metrics visualization
- Test failure details
- Linting error reporting
- Coverage metrics
- Auto-refresh every 2 minutes

### 3. Verification Runner (scripts/run_dashboard.sh)
- Manages dashboard lifecycle
- Runs verification process continuously
- Handles process management
- Maintains log files

### 4. Verification System (scripts/verify_and_fix.sh)
- Runs test suites
- Performs linting checks
- Validates documentation
- Auto-fixes common issues
- Generates detailed logs

## Setup Process

1. Copy core files to project:
   ```
   dashboard/
     ├── index.html
   scripts/
     ├── run_dashboard.sh
     ├── verify_and_fix.sh
     └── auto_fix_code.sh
   ```

2. Initialize dashboard:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_dashboard.sh
   ```

3. Access dashboard:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/dashboard/
   ```

## Integration Guide

1. Add to existing project:
   ```bash
   # Create required directories
   mkdir -p dashboard scripts logs

   # Copy dashboard files
   cp /path/to/template/dashboard/* dashboard/
   cp /path/to/template/scripts/* scripts/

   # Make scripts executable
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. Configure test settings:
   - Update verify_and_fix.sh with project-specific test commands
   - Adjust auto_fix_code.sh for project linting rules
   - Modify dashboard refresh interval if needed

3. Start dashboard:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_dashboard.sh
   ```

## Key Features

- Real-time test status monitoring
- Automatic error detection and reporting
- Code quality metrics
- Test coverage tracking
- Continuous verification (every 2 minutes)
- Auto-fix capabilities for common issues

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Modern web browser
- Bash shell
- Project test suite
- Linting tools (pylint, flake8, etc.)

## File Structure

```
project_root/
  ├── dashboard/
  │   └── index.html          # Dashboard UI
  ├── scripts/
  │   ├── run_dashboard.sh    # Dashboard runner
  │   ├── verify_and_fix.sh   # Verification script
  │   └── auto_fix_code.sh    # Auto-fix script
  └── logs/
      └── verify_and_fix.log  # Verification logs
```

## Best Practices

1. Always run dashboard during development
2. Monitor test failures in real-time
3. Address failing tests promptly
4. Keep verification logs for debugging
5. Regularly update test suites

## Error Handling

- Failed tests displayed immediately
- Linting errors shown with file locations
- Auto-fix attempts logged
- Manual intervention prompts when needed

## Security Considerations

- Local-only server (localhost)
- Read-only access to project files
- No external dependencies
- Sanitized log output
